    <p>
      Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.
      With DevTools you can view and change any page, even the Google homepage, as the video demonstrates.

    <ul>
      <li>Viewing and changing a page's styles.<br><br>Every developer goes through this experience: you code some CSS, and then you view your page and... the styles aren't being applied. Or, they look way different than you expect. This tutorial shows you how to use DevTools to see how the browser is actually applying styles to HTML elements. It also shows you how to change styles from DevTools, which applies the changes immediately without needing to reload the page.</li></br>
      <li>Debugging JavaScript.<br><br>The first way that most developers learn how to debug is to sprinkle console.log() commands throughout their code, in order to infer where the code is going wrong. This tutorial shows you how to set breakpoints in DevTools, which lets you pause in the middle of a page's execution and step through the code one line at a time. While you're paused, you can inspect (and even change) the current values of variables at that point in time. You may find that this workflow helps you debug issues much faster than the console.log() method.</li></br>
      <li>Viewing messages and running JavaScript in the Console.<br><br>The Console provides a chronological log of messages that give you more information about whether a page is running correctly. These messages come from the developers who built the page, or from the browser. You can also run JavaScript from the Console in order to inspect how a page is built, or experiment with changing how the page runs</li></br>
      <li>Analyzing runtime performance.<br><br>If your page is slow or janky, you can use DevTools to record everything that happens on the page, and then analyze the results to learn how to optimize the page's performance.</li></br>
