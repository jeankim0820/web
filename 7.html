    <h2>Further JavaScript</h2>
      <h3>Variables:</h3>
        <p>Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose.
        Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
        You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:</p>
        <pre>
          var pi = 3.14;
          var x = 5;
        </pre>
      <h3>Create a Variable: const</h3>
          <p>Let's dive in and see a variable in the wild.
          Here is how you declare a constant variable:</p>
          <pre>
            const myName = 'Arya';
            console.log(myName);
            // Output: Arya
          </pre>
      <h3>Undefined:</h3>
          <p>What happens if you create a variable, but don't assign it a value?
          JavaScript creates space for this variable in memory and sets it to undefined.
          Undefined is the fifth and final primitive data type.
          JavaScript assigns the undefined data type to variables that are not assigned a value.</p>
          <pre>
            let whatAmI;
          </pre>
          <p>In the example above, we created the variable whatAmI without any value assigned to it.
          JavaScript creates the variable and sets it equal to the value undefined.</p>
      <h3>Mathematical Assignment Operators:</h3>
          <p>In this exercise, let's consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable.
          Check out the example below:</p>
          <pre>
            let x = 4;
            x = x + 1;
          </pre>
          <p>In the example above, we created the variable x with the number 4 assigned to it.
          On the following line, x = x + 1 increases the value of x from 4 to 5.
          Notice, on line two in the example above, to increment x by one we had to write the x variable on the left
          and right side of the assignment operator (=). Using a variable twice in one expression is redundant and confusing.
          To address this, JavaScript has a collection of built-in mathematical assignment operators that make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable without writing the variable twice.
          See examples of these operators below.</p>
          <pre>
            let x = 4;
            x += 2; // x equals 6

            let y = 4;
            y -= 2; // y equals 2

            let z = 4;
            z *= 2; // z equals 8

            let r = 4;
            r++; // r equals 5

            let t = 4;
            t--; // t equals 3
          </pre>
          <p>In the example above, operators are used to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
            Let's consider the first three and last two operators separately:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first three operators (+=, -=, and *=) perform the mathematical operation of the first operator (+, -, or *) using the number on the right, then assign the new value to the variable.</li><br>
              <li>The last two operators are the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. These operators are responsible for increasing and decreasing a number variable by one, respectively.</li><br><br>
            </ul>
        <h3>String Interpolation:</h3>
          <p>In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables.
           Here, you will learn how to insert the content saved to a variable into a string.
           The JavaScript term for inserting the data saved to a variable into a string is string interpolation.
           The + operator, known until now as the addition operator, is used to interpolate (insert) a string variable into a string, as follows:</p>
           <pre>
             let myPet = 'armadillo';
             console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.');
             // Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
           </pre>
         <h3>String Interpolation II:</h3>
           <p>In the newest version of JavaScript (ES6) we can insert variables into strings with ease, by doing two things:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>Instead of using quotes around the string, use backticks (this key is usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key).</li><br>
             <li>Wrap your variable with ${myVariable}, followed by a sentence. No +s necessary.</li><br>
           </ul>
           <p>ES6 string interpolation is easier than the method you used last exercise.
             With ES6 interpolation we can insert variables directly into our text.
             It looks like this:</p>
          <pre>
             let myPet = 'armadillo'
             console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`)
             // Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
             In the example above, the backticks (`) wrap the entire string.
             The variable (myPet) is inserted using ${}. The resulting string is:
             I own a pet armadillo.
          </pre>
          <h3>Review Variables:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables hold reusable data in a program.</li>
              <li>JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.</li>
              <li>You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.</li>
              <li>You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.</li>
              <li>Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.</li>
              <li>Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.</li>
              <li>The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.</li>
              <li>In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Indexing:</h3>
            <p>Did you know that you can access individual characters in a string?
              To access an individual character, you can use the character's location in the string,
              called its index. Just put the index of the character inside square brackets (starting with [0] as the first character) immediately after the string. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
              "James"[0];
              Returns: "J"
            </pre>

            <p>or more commonly, you will see it like this, using a variable:</p>
            <pre>
              var name = "James";
              name[0]; "J"
            </pre>
          <h3>Semicolons;</h3>
          <p>One thing to take notice of in all the examples you've seen so far is the use of semicolons ;
          at the end of each line. Semicolons make it clear where one statement ends and another begins.
          This is especially handy when multiple lines of code are written on the same line (which is valid JavaScript,
          but definitely not recommended!). For instance:</p>

          <pre>
            var totalAfterTax = 53.03
            var tip = 8 // this is incorrect!
            Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token var

            vs.

            var totalAfterTax = 53.03;
            var tip = 8; // this is correct!
          </pre>
          <p>
            Not adding semicolons to the end of each line can cause bugs and errors in your programs.
            JavaScript does have ways to occasionally predict where semicolons should be,
            but just like how type coercion can result in some unexpected quirky behavior in JavaScript,
            it's good practice to not depend on it.</p>

          <h3>Directions:</h3>
          <p>Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values.
          Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation. For example,<br>
          <pre>
          red blue
          </pre>
          where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo.
          Don't forget to use semicolons!
          </p>
