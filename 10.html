      <h2>Data Types</h2>
      <p>What kind of values can we assign to a variable?<br>
        Well, there are multiple possibilities:<br>
        What we call "primitive data types": for example a number, a string, etc. ex:<br>
        var x = 3; var name = "Buffa";playing cards<br>
        Objects (everything that is not a  "primitive data type" is an object):<br>
        var michel = {firstName:'Michel', lastName:'Buffa'};<br>
        There is a set of "predefined objects" in JavaScript (arrays, functions, etc). We will come back on these later in the course.<br>
        JavaScript has a small set of primitive data types<br>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="11.html">number</a>: 1,2,105,3.14 ...</li><br>
        <li><a href="12.html">string</a>: 'a', "one", 'two' , 'World Wide Web' ...</li><br>
        <li>boolean: true / false</li><br>
        <li>undefined: absent or unknown value</li><br>
        <li>null: special keyword, meaning no value or empty. The difference from undefined is that when a variable is null, it is still defined.</li><br>
      </ul>
      <p>These are the simplest forms of data we can use in programming.
        Anything that is not listed above is an object (JavaScript objects are covered later in Week 3).
        You said JavaScript does not have types for variables?
        No! I said that JavaScript is weakly typed; you do not declare the type of variable. In some other languages (Java language syntax, for instance) instead of var x=2; or let name="Buffa"; you would write int x=2; or String name = "Buffa";, with the datatype explicit in the variable declaration.
        Knowing the type of a JavaScript variable: the typeof operator
        The next section of the course talks about "operators" but there is one that is better introduced in this section: the typeof operator, that is useful for knowing the type of a variable depending in its value (possible values: number, string, boolean, undefined, object, or function)
        We will use it in lots of examples in the next three sections.
        dynamic typing. You can use the typeof operator to see the "dynamic type of a variable". For example, type let n=3; then typeof n, it will display "number". Then type n="toto"; and typeof n; this time it displays "string"
        This operator is not often use in JavaScript programs, but it's useful for us, for explaining the data types.
      </p>
      <h3>Number Operators:</h3>
      <p>
        The following arithmetic operators are binary:<br>
        +, - , /, *, % (modulo)<br>
        Example: 7 % 5 equals 2, which is the remainder of the integer division of 7 by 5<br>
        Note: (7 / 5 = 5 * 1 + 2 ).<br>
        And there are also unary operators:<br>
        ++, --, - (the opposite of a number)<br>
        ++ and -- operators increment or decrement the value of a variable. They can be both prefixed or suffixed, which have different effects:<br>
        Suffixed ++ adds one to the value of the variable, then returns the old value.<br>
        Prefixed ++ also adds one to the value, but returns the new value. Both of these must be used with variables.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>
        > var a = 5;
        undefined

        > a += 3 // equivalent to a = a + 3;
        8

        > a -= 2; // equivalent to a = a - 2;
        6

        > a *= 10; // equivalent to a = a * 10;
        60

        > a /= 5; // equivalent to a = a / 5;
        12

        > a %= 2; // equivalent to a = a % 2;
        0

        > // this is normal, as a is even
      </pre>

      <h3>Strings (part 1):</h3>
        <p>
          To declare or manipulate strings you must write them with single quotes ' or double quotes " around them.
          Single quotes or double quotes are both accepted, and there is no difference between them in JavaScript. However, the community prefers to use single quote for string - this is not a convention, but a recommendation.
          And finally, you cannot start a string with a single and end with a double quotes, or the opposite.
        </p>
        <pre>
        > "Hello World";
        "Hello World"

        > "JavaScript Course";
        "JavaScript Course"

        > 'With simple quotes';
        "With simple quotes"

        > "Do not mix double and simple quotes'; // here we opened the string with double and closed with simple quotes
        VM24763:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
        </pre>
        <p>Image from the devtool console, with the example above:<br>
          Snapshot of a devtool console: do not mix simple and double quotes<br>
          There are many reasons to use simple quotes when possible:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Double quotes are used in HTML</li><br>
          <li>You must hold the Shift key to type "</li><br>
          <li>Single quotes are easier to read and to type</li><br>
          <li>To output HTML in JavaScript, single quotes are more useful</li><br>
        </ul>

      <h3>String operators:</h3>
      <p>
        The concatenation operator (+)<br>
        The operator (+) used with strings is called the concatenation operator, and it allows you to concatenate strings.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>
        //the operator (+)
        var s1 = 'one';
        var s2= 'two';
        var s = s1 + s2;
        s;
        // returns 'onetwo'
        typeof s;
        //'string'
      </pre>
      <p>
        The shorthand assignment operator (+=)
        The shorthand assignment operator (+=) can also be used to concatenate strings.
        <pre>
          //the assignment operator (+=)
          var s1 = 'one';
          var s2 = 'two';
          s1+= s2; // or directly s1+='two'
          s1;
          //returns 'onetwo'
        </pre>

    <h3>The method concat()</h3>
      <p>Another way to concatenate strings is the method concat().</p>
    <pre>
      //the 'concat' method
      var s1 = 'one';
      var s2 ='two';
      var s = s1.concat(s2);
      s;
      //returns 'onetwo'
    </pre>
    <p>
      All the methods shown above can be used with a variable number of arguments:
    </p>
      var s1 = 'Hello';
      s1 = s1 + ' World' + ' JavaScript';
      var s2 = 'Hello';
      s2+= ' World' + ' JavaScript';
      var s3 = 'Hello';
      s3.concat(' World' , ' JavaScript' );
      //s1,s2 and s3 return 'Hello World JavaScript'
    </pre>

    <h3>Converting strings</h3>
    <p>A String number in an arithmetic expression is converted to Number, unless the formula is a pure addition.</p>
    <pre>
      > var s = '1'; s = 3 * s; typeof s;
      "number"

      > s;
      3

      > var s = '1'; s++; typeof s;
      "number"

      > s;
      2

      > var s = "100"; typeof s;
      "string"

      > s = s * 1;
      100

      > typeof s;
      "number"

      > var d = "101 dalmatians";
      undefined

      > d * 1;
      NaN
    </pre>
    <p>
      The above example is shown in the devtools console:<br>
      Devtool console showing var s = '1'; s = 3 * s; typeof s; "number" s 3 var s = '1'; s++; typeof s; "number" s 2 var s = "100"; typeof s; "string" s = s * 1; 100 typeof s; "number" var d = '101 dalmatiens'; undefined d * 1 NaN<br>
      How to convert a Number into a String<br>
      There is trick for converting a Number into a String: we concatenate with an empty string, at the beginning of expression (type this in the devtools):
    </p>
    <pre>
      var n = 1;
      typeof n;
      // returns "number"
      n = "" + n;
      // returns "1"
      typeof n;
      // returns "string"
    </pre>

    <h3>Special character: the "\"</h3>
    <p>The \ is useful for "escaping" special characters. Here are a few examples:<br></p>
    <pre>
      var s = 'I don\'t know';
      var s = "I don\'t know"; // here the \ is useless
      var s = "I don't know";  // same result as previous line
      var s = '"Hello", he said.'; // ok, double quotes inside single one will be displayed
      var s = "\"Hello\", he said."; // double quotes inside double quotes need to be escaped
    </pre>
    <p>Escaping the escape! Use a double "\"</p>
    <pre>
      var s = "1\\2"; s;
      // returns "1\2"
    </pre>

    <p>
      Special characters starting with "\"<br>
      "\n" for "next line":<br>
    </p>
    <pre>
      var s = '\n1\n2\n3\n';
      s
      // returns "
      1
      2
      3
      "
      "\r" for "carriage return":
      var s = '1\r2';
      var s = '1\n\r2';
      var s = '1\r\n2';
      // the three previous lines give :
      "1
      2"
      "\t" for "insert a tabulation":
      var s = "1\t2"
      // s is equal to
      "1 2"
    </pre>
