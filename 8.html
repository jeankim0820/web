    <h2>Control Flow</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Introduction to Control Flow:</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we'll explore how we can use the building blocks of JavaScript to write programs that make decisions.
        Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition.
        If a given condition is true, we execute one block of code. If the statement is false, we execute another block of code. For instance,
        if we were making a game in which the user had to choose which door to enter, we'd need a way for the program to know what to do once the user was in the next room.
        In this lesson, we'll learn how to make decisions with JavaScript and how it can control the program's flow.<br>
        DEFINITION: A flowchart is a visual diagram that outlines the solution to a problem through a series of logical statements.
        The order in which statements are evaluated and executed is called the control flow.
      </p>

      <h3>if/else Statements:</h3>
        <p>If...else statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition,
          or set of conditions, being met. The core task of programming is writing lists of instructions for computers,
          or translating our ideas from human-speak to computer-speak.
          Let's learn how we can ask JavaScript to think like us and make decisions the way we do.
          We'll start with human-speak. Many decisions we make everyday boil down to this sentence in some form:
          "If something is true, let's do option 1, or else, if it is false, let's do option 2."
          This sentence looks fairly similar when we write it with JavaScript. See for yourself:</p>
        <pre>
          let needsCoffee = true;
          if (needsCoffee === true) {
            console.log('Finding coffee');
          } else {
            console.log('Keep on keeping on!');
          }
        ...

         if (/* this expression is true */) {
           // run this code
         } else {
           // run this code
         }
       </pre>
       <p>
         This is extremely helpful because it allows you to choose which piece of code you want to run based on the result of an expression. For example,
       </p>
       <pre>
         var a = 1;
         var b = 2;

         if (a > b) {
           console.log("a is greater than b");
         } else {
           console.log("a is less than or equal to b");
         }
       </pre>
       <p>
        Prints: "a is less than or equal to b"<br>

        A couple of important things to notice about if...else statements.<br>

        The value inside the if statement is always converted to true or false.
        Depending on the value, the code inside the if statement is run or the code inside the else statement is run, but not both.
        The code inside the if and else statements are surrounded by curly braces {...} to separate the conditions and indicate which code should be run.<br>
        TIP: When coding, sometimes you may only want to use an if statement. However, if you try to use only an else statement, then you will receive the error SyntaxError: Unexpected token else.
        You’ll see this error because else statements need an if statement in order to work. You can’t have an else statement without first having an if statement.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lines of code between curly braces are called blocks. if/else statements have two code blocks.
        If the variable needsCoffee is true, the program will run the first block of code.
        Otherwise, it will run the other block of code.</li><br>
        <li>needsCoffee is the condition we are checking inside the if's parentheses.
        Since it is equal to true, our program will run the code between the first opening curly brace { (line 2) and the first closing curly brace } (line 4).
        It will ignore the else { ... } part. In this case, we'd see Finding coffee log to the console.</li><br>
        <li>If needsCoffee were false, only the console.log() statement in the else block would be executed.</li><br>
        if/else statements are how programs can process yes/no questions programmatically.</li><br>
      </ul>
      <h4>Directions:</h4>
      <p>
        Write an if...else statement that:<br>
        prints "even" if the number is an even number<br>
        prints "odd" if the number is an odd number<br>
        Hint: Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd.
        The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:
      </p>
      <pre>
        console.log(12 % 3);
        console.log(10 % 4);
        Result:
        0
        2
      </pre>

      <p>
        The answer for 12 % 3 is 0 because twelve divided by three has no remainder. 10 % 4 is 2 because ten divided by 4 has a remainder of two.
        Make sure to test your code with different values. For example:<br>
        If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.<br>
        If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.<br>
      </p>

      <h3>True and False Values:</h3>
        <p>Even non-boolean data types, like strings and numbers, can still be used like booleans to determine control flow.
        In JavaScript, all values have a truthy or falsy value.
        This means that they evaluate to true or false when they are used as a part of a control flow condition.
        All variables that have been declared and assigned are truthy unless they contain one of the six values listed below:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>false</li>
        <li>0 and -0</li>
        <li>"" and '' (empty strings)</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>NaN (Not a Number)</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        For example:<br>
      <div>
        <pre>
          let variableOne = 'I Exist!';
          if (variableOne) {
              // This code will run because variableOne contains a truthy value.
          } else {
             // This code will not run because the first block ran.
          }
        </pre>

        <p>The second line of this program checks a condition if (variableOne). By only writing the name of the variable as the condition, we are checking the truthiness of the variableOne. In this case, variableOne behaves like the value true because a string that is not empty is truthy.
            Here is an example with numbers.</p>
        <pre>
          let numberOfApples = 0;
          if(numberOfApples){
             console.log('Let us eat!'); // This code will not run because 0 is a falsy value
          } else {
             console.log('No food left!'); // This code will run
          }
        </pre>
        <ul>
        <li>Since 0 is one of the six falsy values, the code within the else block runs.</li><br>
        <li>There is an important distinction between a variable's value and its truthiness:</li><br>
         <li>numberOfApples's value is 0 because that is the data saved to the variable.</li><br>
        <li>numberOfApples is falsy when used in control flow because it exists and does contain one of the six falsy values listed above.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Else if statements:</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, you can represent this secondary check by using an extra if statement called an else if statement.

        <pre>
          var weather = "sunny";

          if (weather === "snow") {
            console.log("Bring a coat.");
          } else if (weather === "rain") {
            console.log("Bring a rain jacket.");
          } else {
            console.log("Wear what you have on.");
          }
        </pre>
          Prints: Wear what you have on.

          By adding the extra else if statement, you're adding an extra conditional statement.

          If it’s not going to snow, then the code will jump to the else if statement to see if it’s going to rain.
          If it’s not going to rain, then the code will jump to the else statement.

          The else statement essentially acts as the "default" condition in case all the other if statements are false.
        </p>


        <h3>True and False Values II:</h3>

        <p>
          In programming, we often evaluate whether or not an expression is true or truthy. Conveniently, JavaScript provides a shorthand notation for this.
        </p>
        <pre>
            let isRaining = true;
            if (isRaining) {
               console.log('Carry an umbrella!');
            } else {
              console.log('Enjoy the sun!');
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the condition is simply if (isRaining).
          In JavaScript, this is evaluating whether isRaining is truthy.
          If you read the code out loud to yourself, it sounds like a simple sentence:
          "If it's raining, carry an umbrella. Else, enjoy the sun!"
          JavaScript provides an operator for swapping the truthiness and falsiness of values - the exclamation point (!).
          We can use this in conditional statements as shorthand to check if the value of a variable evaluates to false rather than true.<br><br>
        </P>
        <pre>
            let isPhoneCharged = true;
            if (!isPhoneCharged) {
              console.log('Plug in your phone!');
            } else {
              console.log('No need to charge!');
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the program checks if isPhoneCharged evaluates to false.
          Because isPhoneCharged is true, the second block of code will execute.</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Comparison Operators:</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to checking whether a variable evaluates to true or false, sometimes we need to compare variables to other values. We can achieve this with comparison operators.
          There are two comparisons you might be familiar with:</p>
          Less than: <<br>
          Greater than: ><br><br>
          You may also recognize these:<br><br>

          Less than or equal to: <=<br>
          Greater than or equal to: >=<br>
          These comparisons evaluate to true or false.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Comparison Operators II:</h3>
          <p>There are two more useful comparisons we can make. Often, we might want to check if two things are equal to each other or if they are not.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To check if two things equal each other, we write === (three = signs in a row).</li><br>
            <li>To check if two things do not equal each other, we write !== (an exclamation with two = signs in a row).</li><br>
          </ul>
          <p>It can be confusing when to use one = sign and when to use three === signs. Use a single = to assign a value to a variable.
              Use ===to compare the values of two different variables.</p>

        <h4>Comparing strings</h4>
          <p>Another way to work with strings is by comparing them. You've seen the comparison operators == and != when you compared numbers for equality. You can also use them with strings! For example, let’s compare the string "Yes" to "yes".</p>
          <pre>
          "Yes" == "yes"
          Returns: false
          </pre>
          <p>When you run this in the console, it returns false. Why is that? "Yes" and "yes" are the same string, right? Well not quite.</p>

        <h4>Case-sensitive</h4>
          <p>When you compare strings, case matters. While both string use the same letters (and those letters appear in the same order),
            the first letter in the first string is a capital Y while the first letter in the second string is a lowercase y.</p>
          <pre>
          'Y' != 'y'
          Returns: true
          </pre>

        <h4>null/define/NaN</h4>
        <p>null refers to the "value of nothing".<br>
            undefined refers to the "absence of value".<br>
            NaN stands for "Not-A-Number" and it's often returned indicating an error with number operations. For instance,
            if you wrote some code that performed a math calculation,
            and the calculation failed to produce a valid number, NaN might be returned.</p>
        <pre>
        // calculating the square root of a negative number will return NaN
        Math.sqrt(-10)

        // trying to divide a string by 5 will return NaN
        "hello"/5
        </pre>

        <h4>Equality</h4>
        <p>So far, you’ve seen how you can use == and != to compare numbers and strings for equality. However, if you use == and != in situations where the data you’re comparing is mixed, it can lead to some interesting results. For example,</p>
        <pre>
        "1" == 1
        Returns: true

        and

        0 == false
        Returns: true
        </pre>
        <p>both evaluate to true. Why is that?</p>

        <h4>Implicit type coercion</h4>
        <p>JavaScript is known as a loosely typed language.<br>
        Basically, this means that when you’re writing JavaScript code, you do not need to specify data types.
        Instead, when your code is interpreted by the JavaScript engine it will automatically be converted into the "appropriate" data type.
        This is called implicit type coercion and you’ve already seen examples like this before when you tried to concatenate strings with numbers.</p>
        <pre>
        "julia" + 1
        Returns: "julia1"
        </pre>
        <p>In this example, JavaScript takes the string "julia" and adds the number 1 to it resulting in the string "julia1".
          In other programming languages, this code probably would have returned an error, but in JavaScript the number 1 is converted into the string "1" and then is concatenated to the string "julia".
          It’s behavior like this which makes JavaScript unique from other programming languages, but it can lead to some quirky behavior when doing operations and comparisons on mixed data types.
        </p>

        <h4>DEFINITION:</h4>
        <p>A strongly typed language is a programming language that is more likely to generate errors if data does not closely match an expected type.
          Because JavaScript is loosely typed, you don’t need to specify data types; however, this can lead to errors that are hard to diagnose due to implicit type coercion.
          Example of strongly typed programming language code
        </p>
        <pre>
        int count = 1;
        string name = "Julia";
        double num = 1.2932;
        float price = 2.99;
        </pre>
        <h4>Equivalent code in JavaScript</h4>
        <pre>
        // equivalent code in JavaScript
        var count = 1;
        var name = "Julia";
        var num = 1.2932;
        var price = 2.99;
        </pre>
        <p>In the example below, JavaScript takes the string "1", converts it to true, and compares it to the boolean true.</p>
        <pre>
        "1" == true
        Returns: true
        </pre>
        <p>When you use the == or != operators, JavaScript first converts each value to the same type (if they’re not already the same type);
          this is why it's called "type coercion"! This is often not the behavior you want,
          and <strong>it’s actually considered bad practice to use the == and != operators when comparing values for equality.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4>Strict equality</h4>
        <p>
          Instead, in JavaScript it’s better to use strict equality to see if numbers, strings, or booleans, etc. are identical in type and value without doing the type conversion first.
          To perform a strict comparison, simply add an additional equals sign = to the end of the == and != operators.
        </p>
        <pre>
        "1" === 1
        Returns: false
        </pre>
        <p>This returns false because the string "1" is not the same type and value as the number 1.</p>
        <pre>
        0 === false
        Returns: false
        </pre>
        <p>This returns false because the number 0 is not the same type and value as the boolean false.</p>

        <h3>Logical Operators:</h3>
        <p>
          Logical operators can be used in conjunction with boolean values (true and false) to create complex logical expressions.
          By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, you create a logical expression that returns another boolean value. Here’s a table describing the different logical operators:
        </p>
        <h4>Operator	Meaning	Example	How it works</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>&&	Logical AND	value1 && value2	Returns true if both value1 and value2 evaluate to true.</li>
          <li>||	Logical OR	value1 || value2	Returns true if either value1 or value2 (or even both!) evaluates to true.</li>
          <li>!	Logical NOT	!value1	Returns the opposite of value1. If value1 is true, then !value1 is false.</li>
          <li>By using logical operators, you can create more complex conditionals like Julia’s weekend example.</li>
        </ul>
        <H4>>Here’s the logical expression used to represent Julia’s weekend plans:</h4>
        <pre>
          var colt = "not busy";
          var weather = "nice";

          if (colt === "not busy" && weather === "nice") {
            console.log("go to the park");
          }
          Prints: "go to the park"
        </pre>

        <h4>Notice the && in the code above.</h4>
        <p>
          The && symbol is the logical AND operator, and it is used to combine two logical expressions into one larger logical expression.
          If both smaller expressions are true, then the entire expression evaluates to true.
          If either one of the smaller expressions is false, then the whole logical expression is false.
          Another way to think about it is when the && operator is placed between the two statements,
          the code literally reads, "if Colt is not busy AND the weather is nice, then go to the park".
        </p>
        <h3>Logical expressions:</h3>
        <p>Logical expressions are similar to mathematical expressions, except logical expressions evaluate to either true or false.</p>
        <pre>
          11 != 12
          Returns: true
        </pre>
        <p>
          You’ve already seen logical expressions when you write comparisons.
          A comparison is just a simple logical expression.
          Similar to mathematical expressions that use +, -, *, / and %,
          there are logical operators &&, || and ! that you can use to create more complex logical expressions.
          We can translate certain thoughts into JavaScript code such as, "Are these things equal?" with ===, or, "Is one thing greater than another thing?" with >.
          In English, sometimes we say "both of these things" or "either one of these things." Let's translate those phrases into JavaScript with special operators called logical operators.
        </p>
        <pre>
          To say "both must be true," we use &&.
          To say "either can be true," we use ||.
          For example:

          if (stopLight === 'green' && pedestrians === false) {
            console.log('Go!');
          } else {
            console.log('Stop');
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we make sure that the stopLight is 'green' and (&&) there are no pedestrians before we log Go!.
          If either of those conditions is false, we log Stop.Just like the operators we learned previously, these logical operators will return either true or false.
          These logical operators are helpful when writing if/else statements since they let us make sure multiple variables are true or false.
          We can combine these operators with all of the ones we have learned throughout this lesson.
        </p>

        <h3>Ternary Operator:</h3>
        <p>
          In the previous exercise, we learned shorthand for writing multiple if/else if/else statements to make them easier to read.
          JavaScript also provides a way to shorten simple if/else statements called the ternary operator.</p>
        <pre>
          let isNightTime = true;
          if (isNightTime) {
            console.log('Turn on the lights!');
          } else {
            console.log('Turn off the lights!');
        </pre>
        <p>In the example above, we see a very familiar pattern. See the example below for an equivalent way to express this.
          isNightTime ?
        <pre>
          console.log('Turn on the lights!') :
          console.log('Turn off the lights!');

        <p>The code in the example above will operate exactly as the code from the previous example.
          Let's break this example into its parts:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>isNightTime ? <br>
            — the conditional statement followed by a question mark. This checks if isNightTime is truthy.</li><br>
          <li>console.log ('Turn on the lights!')<br>
              — this code will be executed if the condition is truthy.</li><br>
          <li>: <br>
            — a colon separates the two different blocks of code that can be executed.</li><br>
          <li>console.log('Turn off the lights!'); <br>
            — this code will be executed if the condition is falsy</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this example, we checked if the value of a variable was true or false.
          The ternary operator can be used for any condition that can be evaluated to true or false, such as those with comparison operators.
        </p>
        <pre>
          age >= 16 ? console.log('You are old enough to drive in the United States!') :
          console.log('You are not old enough to drive in the United States!')
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the conditional statement is checking whether the value of the variable age is greater than or equal to 16.
          If so, a message that states the user is old enough to drive will be logged to the console.
          Otherwise, a message that states the user is not old enough to drive will be logged.
